# BUGS in the Perfect Me App

1. On the dashboard page when one task is marked as complete the Progress bar updates correctly and the percentage displayed in the progress bar is correct (i.e. it is showing the weighted percentage for the task). But the percentage that is displayed to the right of the progress bar shows a percentage of the number of tasks complete, this can be removed. When a second task is set to complete the progress bar is reset to nothing and the percentage total is not displayed within the progress bar. The percentage that is displayed in the Tasks Completed box above the progress bar now shows 0%, not a total of the two weighted percentages added together. These issues need fixing.

# UPDATES

1. Delete the tasks from the current day so I can test again
